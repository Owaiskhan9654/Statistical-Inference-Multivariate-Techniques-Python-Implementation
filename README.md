Z-tests are statistical calculations that can be used to compare population 
means to a sample's. 
T-tests are calculations used to test a hypothesis, but they are most useful when we need to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two independent sample groups.
The chi-square distribution arises in tests of hypotheses concerning the independence of two random variables and concerning whether a discrete random variable follows a specified distribution. 
The F-distribution arises in tests of hypotheses concerning whether or not two population variances are equal and concerning whether or not three or more population means are equal
